### Transformation
We would like to study these datasets in more depth to find out about the  Appâ€™s ratings, reviews, price, etc. Therefore we took steps to clean data by removing duplicates so we would work with more accurate data, removing columns that are not useful for the purpose of this analysis and work only with data from which useful insights can be drawn, and renaming columns.
| File Name | Data  Frame Name | Kept Columns | Renamed Columns |
| :---         |     ---      |   --- |          --- |
| extended_googleplaystore.csv   | clean_neo (removed 15 columns)| App, Genres (categorical), Rating, Reviews, Installs, Type, Price, Content Rating  |<ul><li>Genres (categorical)' changed to 'genre </li> <li>All other columns changed to lower case </li> <li>Spaces on columns names replaced with "_" </li></ul>
| extended_googleplaystore_user_reviews.csv    | clean_neo_reviews (removed 30 columns)| app,  translated_review, original_sentiment|<ul><li> All columns names changed to lower case. </li> <li>Spaces on columns names replaced with "_" </li></ul>
|Google-Playstore.csv |clean_gauthamp (removed 14 columns)|app_name, category, rating, rating_count, installs, free, price, content_rating, ad_supported, in_app_purchases|<ul><li> All columns names changed to lower case. </li> <li>Spaces on columns names replaced with "_" </li></ul>

### Load
This information will allow us to decide whether or not to charge for an app we are creating. This will allow us to also decide what updates we may want to include in our app, which genre and content rating our app should have, and how ratings and reviews would correlate with the success of our app.
